            At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we divide our academic year into four terms: Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer. This structure allows us to build learning themes and activities around seasonal and cultural events, while also ensuring alignment with South Manchester (Trafford Council) school holidays.

            We offer Saturday Slovak language lessons at two locations:
            
            Morning (AM) Sessions: 10:00 – 12:00 at The Firs Primary School Afternoon (PM) Sessions: 14:00 – 16:00 at Sale High School
            
            Although we primarily serve South Manchester, we welcome students from all areas.
               
                        
        
        <div class="content"><p>Note: Term dates align with Trafford Council school holidays where possible, though some variations may apply.
